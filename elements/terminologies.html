    <h1>Key Git Terminologies</h1>
    
    <section class="terminology">
        <h2>1. Repository (Repo)</h2>
        <p>A repository is the directory where your project resides. A Git repository includes all of the project’s files and the entire history of the project. You can have a local repository (on your machine) and a remote repository (on a service like GitHub).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Repository</strong>: Stored on your computer. You work with this repo while developing.</li>
            <li><strong>Remote Repository</strong>: Stored on an external server like GitHub or GitLab. You push your changes to this repo so that others can see your work.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="terminology">
        <h2>2. Commit</h2>
        <p>A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It represents a group of changes that you save to your repository. Each commit contains a message describing what changes were made, the files that were modified, and a unique identifier (hash).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commit Message</strong>: A short description of the changes made. Good commit messages help others (and yourself) understand the project's evolution.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="terminology">
        <h2>3. Branch</h2>
        <p>A branch is an independent line of development. Git allows you to create multiple branches to work on different features or bug fixes independently. The main branch is usually the default branch in a Git repository, but you can create other branches (e.g., feature-login, bugfix-header) to isolate your work.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Branch?</strong>: Branches let developers work on new features without impacting the main codebase. Once the feature is ready, it can be merged back into the main branch.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="terminology">
        <h2>4. Merge</h2>
        <p>Merging combines changes from one branch into another. Typically, when you finish working on a branch (e.g., feature-login), you merge it back into the main branch to integrate the new changes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fast-forward Merge</strong>: If no other changes were made in the main branch, Git simply moves the branch pointer forward.</li>
            <li><strong>Three-way Merge</strong>: If both branches have new changes, Git performs a three-way merge by finding the common base, comparing both branches, and resolving conflicts.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="terminology">
        <h2>5. Remote</h2>
        <p>A remote is a version of your project hosted on a server. It allows collaboration with others. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket are popular services for hosting Git remotes.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Remotes?</strong>: You can collaborate with others by pushing your changes to a shared repository. This enables code reviews, continuous integration (CI), and other team-based workflows.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="terminology">
        <h2>6. Staging Area</h2>
        <p>The staging area is like a buffer zone where you prepare changes before committing them. This allows you to review what will be included in the next commit and to group changes logically.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Stage Changes?</strong>: You might be working on multiple parts of a project, but only want to commit some of the changes. Staging helps you organize these changes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="terminology">
        <h2>7. Working Directory</h2>
        <p>The working directory is the folder on your computer where you’re actively making changes to your files. This directory contains files that are not yet committed or staged.</p>
