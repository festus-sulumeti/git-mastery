        <h2>Introduction to Branching and Merging</h2>
        <p>Branching and merging are key features of Git that enable developers to work on different tasks (features, bug fixes, etc.) in parallel without interfering with the main codebase. This guide will explore how branches work, the types of merges, and best practices for effective branching and merging strategies.</p>

        <h2>1. Git Branching</h2>
        <p>A branch in Git is essentially a pointer to a specific snapshot of your project. The default branch, usually called <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>, contains your production-ready code. However, you can create separate branches to work on features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.</p>
        
        <h3>1.1 Creating a New Branch</h3>
        <p>To create a new branch in Git:</p>
        <pre><code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>This creates a new branch that points to the same commit as the current branch.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Switching Branches</h3>
        <p>Once you’ve created a branch, you can switch to it:</p>
        <pre><code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Or, using the newer command:</p>
        <pre><code>git switch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        
        <h3>1.3 Viewing Branches</h3>
        <p>To see all branches in your local repository:</p>
        <pre><code>git branch</code></pre>
        <p>This will display a list of branches, with the current branch highlighted by an asterisk (*).</p>

        <h3>1.4 Deleting a Branch</h3>
        <p>Once you’re done with a branch, you can delete it:</p>
        <pre><code>git branch -d &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>This command deletes the branch locally, but only if it has been merged. Use <code>-D</code> to force deletion without merging.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="merging">
        <h2>2. Git Merging</h2>
        <p>Merging is the process of combining the work from different branches into a single branch. After completing work on a feature or bug fix in a branch, you'll typically merge it back into the main branch.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Fast-Forward Merge</h3>
        <p>A fast-forward merge happens when the current branch has not diverged from the branch you are merging. In this case, Git simply moves the branch pointer forward, incorporating all changes.</p>
        <pre><code>git checkout main
git merge &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Git will move the <code>main</code> branch pointer forward to include all changes from <code>&lt;branch-name&gt;</code>.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Three-Way Merge</h3>
        <p>When two branches have diverged, Git performs a three-way merge. This type of merge compares the common ancestor of the two branches with the changes in both branches to create a new merge commit.</p>
        <p>Steps to perform a three-way merge:</p>
        <pre><code>git checkout main
git merge &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Git will combine the changes from both branches and create a merge commit in the <code>main</code> branch.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Merge Conflicts</h3>
        <p>A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve the differences between two branches. This happens when the same lines in a file have been modified in both branches.</p>
        <p>When a conflict occurs, Git marks the conflicting areas in the file:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Your changes in the current branch
=======
Changes from the branch you are merging
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-name
        </code></pre>
        <h4>Steps to Resolve a Conflict:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Manually edit the file to remove conflict markers and choose which changes to keep.</li>
            <li>Stage the resolved file with <code>git add &lt;file-name&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li>Commit the resolved changes with <code>git commit</code>.</li>
        </ol>

    <section class="rebase">
        <h2>3. Git Rebase</h2>
        <p>Rebasing is an alternative to merging that creates a linear commit history by moving or "replaying" your commits on top of another branch.</p>
        
        <h3>3.1 Basic Rebasing</h3>
        <p>To rebase a feature branch on top of the main branch:</p>
        <pre><code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;
git rebase main</code></pre>
        <p>Rebasing moves your feature branch to begin on the latest commit in <code>main</code>, effectively replaying your changes on top of it.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Benefits of Rebase</h3>
        <p>Rebasing keeps the project history clean and linear, which makes it easier to follow. However, it should be used with caution, especially when working in teams, as it rewrites commit history.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Rebase Conflicts</h3>
        <p>Similar to merging, rebasing can lead to conflicts. You will need to resolve conflicts in the same way as merge conflicts, and continue the rebase:</p>
        <pre><code>git rebase --continue</code></pre>

        <h3>3.4 When to Use Rebase vs Merge</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Merge:</strong> Use merge when you want to retain the history of both branches and include a merge commit.</li>
            <li><strong>Rebase:</strong> Use rebase when you want a clean, linear history without merge commits.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="branching-strategies">
        <h2>4. Branching Strategies</h2>
        <p>There are several common branching strategies to ensure smooth development in teams. These include:</p>

        <h3>4.1 Git Flow</h3>
        <p>Git Flow is a popular branching model that involves two main branches, <code>main</code> (production-ready) and <code>develop</code> (latest changes), along with feature, release, and hotfix branches.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Feature Branching</h3>
        <p>In this model, developers create separate branches for each feature or bug fix. These branches are merged back into the main branch only after the work is complete and tested.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Trunk-Based Development</h3>
        <p>This strategy encourages small, frequent commits directly to the main branch. Developers work in short-lived branches or commit directly to the main branch, minimizing the time spent working in isolation.</p>

        <h2>5. Best Practices for Branching and Merging</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep Branches Short-Lived:</strong> Avoid long-lived branches to minimize merge conflicts and keep the project moving forward.</li>
            <li><strong>Commit Frequently:</strong> Make small, frequent commits to ensure that your work is saved incrementally.</li>
            <li><strong>Pull Often:</strong> Regularly pull from the remote repository to keep your branch up-to-date.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Descriptive Branch Names:</strong> Use meaningful names like <code>feature/add-login</code> or <code>bugfix/fix-signup</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Before Merging:</strong> Ensure that your branch is fully tested before merging it into the main branch.</li>
        </ul>
